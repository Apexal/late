- To automatically allocate free time in a userâ€™s calendar to work on/study for assignments/tests.
- To remind users to follow the allocated study/work times through means including notifications, text messages, etc.
- To account for missing scheduled work by reallocating work times

**Target Audience**
The target audience is college students who use tools such as Google Calendar to track their daily schedules.

- Clone the repository
- Checkout the `dev` branch with `$ git checkout dev`
- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` in the root folder with the proper configuration environment variables **TEAM MEMBERS:** Ask Frank for the official `.env` file
- Run LATE with `$ ./run-hot-docker`. If you need to update backend files, pass `--build` to the command.
- Go to url `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

#### Manual Install

Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed with version `>= 11.0.0`.

- Clone the repository
- Checkout the `dev` branch with `$ git checkout dev`
- `$ npm install -g @vue/cli`
- `$ npm install`
- Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` in the root folder with the proper configuration environment variables **TEAM MEMBERS:** Ask Frank for the official `.env` file

To run the project in development mode, you must run the API server in one terminal and the front end hot-reloading server in another terminal:

- `$ sudo npm run fix-watch` (Linux users only, may be required if Vue-cli complains about file watchers)
- `$ npm run frontend` to run the hot-reloading Vue server (in one terminal)
- `$ npm run backend` to run the API server (in another terminal)
- Go to url `http://localhost:8080` (whatever `$ npm run frontend` tells you go to) in your browser
