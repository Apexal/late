### Overview

**LATE** is a web app that tracks and automatically distributes your homework/study time based on your calendar while also adapting if you fall off schedule.

**Goals**

- To provide the user with a clear list of all upcoming assignments and tests.
- To automatically use free time in a userâ€™s calendar to work on/study for assignments/tests.
- To remind users to follow the allocated study/work times through means including notifications, text messages, etc.
- To account for missing scheduled work by reallocating work times

**Target Audience**
The target audience is college students who use tools such as Google Calendar to track their daily schedules.
