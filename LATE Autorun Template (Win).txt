::Made by Tyler Machado, a quick setup script to automate the process of running LATE locally for testing. Contact me if any issues arise!
::(Currently only known to work on Windows)

::***Replace this with your base directory for LATE (likely will end in \late)
SET dir= C:\Example\something\late


::Once you're done editing this file, save it and change the extension to .bat (make sure to remove the .txt)
::Running it should then automatically launch two command prompt windows. Then all you need to do is wait for the processes to finish booting up, then open a new browser tab and go to http://localhost:8080


::DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE
START cmd /k "title LATE Autorun && cd %dir% && npm run backend --fix"
START cmd /k "title LATE Autorun && cd %dir% && npm run frontend --fix"
