/**
 * LATE uses the Axios library to easily make HTTP requests to the server
 * or to any url. It is available to all components as 'this.$http'
 *
 * Making requests is extremely easy. You can make GET, POST, PUSH, DELETE, etc.
 * requests simply by calling the appropriate function this.$http.<HTTP VERB>, e.g.
 * this.$http.get(), this.$http.post()
 *
 * They should be made in asynchronous functions
 * since the requests are asynchronous. For example:
 *
 * async function getAssignments() {
 *   const request = await this.$http.get('/assignments')
 *   const assignments = request.data.assignments
 * }
 *
 * It is common to wrap an API call in a try-catch block to handle an error:
 *
 * async function addAssignment() {
 *   const data = { ... }
 *   let request
 *   try {
 *     request = await this.$http.post('/assignments', data)
 *   } catch (e) {
 *     alert('Failed to add assignment: ' + e)
 *   }
 * }
 *
