      LATE's Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>
        This privacy notice discloses the privacy practices for LATE
        <a href="https://www.late.work">(https://www.late.work)</a>. This
        privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this website.
        It will notify you of the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            What personally identifiable
            information is collected from you through the website, how it is used
            and with whom it may be shared.
          </li>
          <li>
            What choices are available to you
            regarding the use of your data.
          </li>
          <li>
            The security procedures in place to
            protect the misuse of your information.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We
        only have access to information you voluntarily give us by either
        manually filling in forms or allowing us to grab information from SIS
        for you. We will never sell or rent this data to anyone. We will only
        use your information to provide you with the site's services. Some
        information you give us can be made public at your request by using
        certain features of the site. These are always toggleable so that any
        information you accidentally share can be turned private. Some
        anonymized summaries of your data might be used to provide services to
        every user of the site, e.g. showing a user the average number of
        assignments students have in one course by using your and other's number
        of assignments in that course.
      </p>
      <p>
        We use "cookies" on this site. A cookie
        is a piece of data stored on a site visitor's hard drive to help us
        improve your access to our site and identify repeat visitors to our
        site. For instance, when we use a cookie to identify you, you would not
        have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on
        our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally
        identifiable information on our site. In order to use this website, a
        user must first complete the setup process. During setup a user is asked
        to give certain information (such as name, course schedule, etc.). At
        your option, you may also provide additional information (such as
        graduation year, major, etc.) about yourself, but it is not required.
      </p>

      <h3>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h3>
      <p>
        You can do the following at any time through LATE's site or through
        email contact with us:

        <ol>
          <li>See what data we have about you, if any.</li>
          <li>Change/correct any data we have about you.</li>
          <li>
            Have us delete any data we
            have about you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Express any concern you have about our use of your
            data.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        We take precautions to protect your information. We do not store your
        SIS RIN or PIN (password) nor are they ever logged anywhere. We only
        store basic identifiable student information such as your RCS ID (RPI
        email). There is no possibility that an attacker could gain access to
        your SIS account through our site's data. Wherever we collect sensitive
        information (such as temporarily SIS credentials), that information is
        encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by
        looking for a lock icon in the address bar and looking for "https" at
        the beginning of the address of the Web page. This website contains
        links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for
        the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our
        users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy
        statements of any other site that collects personally identifiable
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        By using LATE, you agree to the policy above.
